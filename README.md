🌤️ Weather Data Visualization using OpenWeatherMap API

📌 Internship Task 1 — CodTech
This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API (OpenWeatherMap) using Python and visualize the fetched data with matplotlib. It helps build foundational knowledge in API requests, JSON parsing, and data visualization.

📁 Project Overview
This Python script:
1. Takes a city name as input.
2. Fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Parses and displays key weather metrics.
4. Visualizes the data using a horizontal bar chart.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python
requests – for HTTP API integration
matplotlib – for data visualization
datetime – for time formatting

🧾 Requirements
Before running the script, install the required Python libraries:
pip install requests matplotlib

▶️ How to Run
Open the script in any Python IDE or terminal.

Run the script:
python Task1.py
Enter the city name when prompted.

📊 Sample Output:

Weather data for the entered city will be printed (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, etc.)
